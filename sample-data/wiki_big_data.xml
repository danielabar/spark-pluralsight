'''Big data''' is a term for [[data set]]s that are so large or complex that traditional [[data processing]] applications are inadequate.  Challenges include [[Data analysis|analysis]], capture, [[data curation]], search, [[Data sharing|sharing]], [[Computer data storage|storage]], [[Data transmission|transfer]], [[Data visualization|visualization]], [[Query language|querying]], updating and [[information privacy]]. The term often refers simply to the use of [[predictive analytics]], [[user behavior analytics]], or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-21569-3|title=New Horizons for a Data-Driven Economy – Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-21569-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accuracy in big data may lead to more confident decision making, and better decisions can result in greater operational efficiency, cost reduction and reduced risk.

Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to &quot;spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on.&quot;{{r|Economist}} Scientists, business executives, practitioners of medicine, advertising and [[Government database|governments]] alike regularly meet difficulties with large data sets in areas including [[Web search engine|Internet search]], finance, [[urban informatics]], and [[business informatics]].  Scientists encounter limitations in [[e-Science]] work, including [[meteorology]], [[genomics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Community cleverness required |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7209 |page=1 |date=4 September 2008 |doi=10.1038/455001a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7209/full/455001a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[connectomics]], complex physics simulations, biology and environmental research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reichman |first1=O.J. |last2=Jones |first2=M.B. |last3=Schildhauer |first3=M.P. |title=Challenges and Opportunities of Open Data in Ecology |journal=Science |volume=331 |issue=6018 |pages=703–5 |year=2011 |doi=10.1126/science.1197962 |pmid=21311007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data sets are growing rapidly in part because they are increasingly gathered by cheap and numerous information-sensing [[mobile device]]s, aerial ([[remote sensing]]), software logs, [[Digital camera|cameras]], microphones, [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) readers and [[wireless sensor networks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hellerstein, Joe |title=Parallel Programming in the Age of Big Data |date=9 November 2008 |work=Gigaom Blog |url=http://gigaom.com/2008/11/09/mapreduce-leads-the-way-for-parallel-programming/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Toby |last1=Segaran |first2=Jeff |last2=Hammerbacher |title=Beautiful Data: The Stories Behind Elegant Data Solutions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxNglqU1FKgC |year=2009 |publisher=O'Reilly Media |isbn=978-0-596-15711-1 |page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;&lt;ref name=&quot;martinhilbert.net&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin | first2 = Priscila |last2=López | title = The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information | journal = Science | volume = 332 | issue = 6025 | pages = 60–65 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1126/science.1200970 | pmid = 21310967 | url=http://martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012|lc=on}}, every day 2.5 [[exabyte]]s (2.5×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;) of data is created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/big-data/us/en/ |title=IBM What is big data? – Bringing big data to the enterprise |publisher=www.ibm.com |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big data initiatives that affect the entire organization.&lt;ref&gt;Oracle and FSN, [http://www.fsn.co.uk/channel_bi_bpm_cpm/mastering_big_data_cfo_strategies_to_transform_insight_into_opportunity#.UO2Ac-TTuys &quot;Mastering Big Data: CFO Strategies to Transform Insight into Opportunity&quot;], December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Relational database management system]]s and desktop statistics and visualization packages often have difficulty handling big data. The work instead requires &quot;massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jacobs, A. |title=The Pathologies of Big Data |date=6 July 2009 |work=ACMQueue |url=http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1563874}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered &quot;big data&quot; varies depending on the capabilities of the users and their tools, and expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. &quot;For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options.

== Characteristics ==
Big data can be described by the following characteristics:&lt;ref name=&quot;BD4D&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WhatIsBigData&quot; /&gt;

;Volume: The quantity of generated and stored data. The size of the data determines the value and potential insight- and whether it can actually be considered big data or not.

;Variety: The type and nature of the data. This helps people who analyze it to effectively use the resulting insight.

;Velocity: In this context, the speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development.

;Variability: Inconsistency of the data set can hamper processes to handle and manage it.

;Veracity: The quality of captured data can vary greatly, affecting accurate analysis.

Factory work and [[Cyber-physical system]]s may have a 6C system:
* Connection (sensor and networks)
* Cloud (computing and data on demand)&lt;ref&gt;Wu, D., Liu. X., Hebert, S., Gentzsch, W., Terpenny, J. (2015). Performance Evaluation of Cloud-Based High Performance Computing for Finite Element Analysis. Proceedings of the ASME 2015 International Design Engineering Technical Conference &amp; Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC/CIE2015), Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = D. | last2 = Rosen | first2 = D.W. | last3 = Wang | first3 = L. | last4 = Schaefer | first4 = D. | year = 2015 | title = Cloud-Based Design and Manufacturing: A New Paradigm in Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation | url = | journal = Computer-Aided Design | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 1–14 | doi = 10.1016/j.cad.2014.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cyber (model and memory)
* Content/context (meaning and correlation)
* Community (sharing and collaboration)
* Customization (personalization and value)

Data must be processed with advanced tools (analytics and algorithms) to reveal meaningful information. For example, to manage a factory one must consider both visible and invisible issues with various components. Information generation algorithms must detect and address invisible issues such as machine degradation, component wear, etc. on the factory floor.&lt;ref name=INDIN2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Bagheri|first2=Behrad|last3=Kao|first3=Hung-An|title=Recent Advances and Trends of Cyber-Physical Systems and Big Data Analytics in Industrial Informatics|journal=IEEE Int.

== Architecture ==

In 2000, Seisint Inc. (now [[LexisNexis|LexisNexis Group]]) developed a C++-based distributed file-sharing framework for data storage and query. The system stores and distributes structured, semi-structured, and [[unstructured data]] across multiple servers. Users can build queries in a C++ [[Dialect (computing)|dialect]] called [[ECL programming language|ECL]]. ECL uses an &quot;apply schema on read&quot; method to infer the structure of stored data when it is queried, instead of when it is stored. In 2004, LexisNexis acquired Seisint Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50577-2004Jul14.html|title=LexisNexis To Buy Seisint For $775 Million|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=15 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 acquired [[ChoicePoint|ChoicePoint, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/21/AR2008022100809.html|title=LexisNexis Parent Set to Buy ChoicePoint|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their high-speed parallel processing platform. The two platforms were merged into [[HPCC]] (or High-Performance Computing Cluster) Systems and in 2011, HPCC was open-sourced under the Apache v2.0 License. Currently, HPCC and [[Quantcast File System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datanami.com/2012/10/01/quantcast_opens_exabyte_ready_file_system/|title=Quantcast Opens Exabyte-Ready File System|publisher=www.datanami.com|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the only publicly available platforms capable of analyzing multiple exabytes of data.

In 2004, [[Google]] published a paper on a process called [[MapReduce]] that uses a similar architecture. The MapReduce concept provides a parallel processing model, and an associated implementation was released to process huge amounts of data.  With MapReduce, queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel (the Map step). The results are then gathered and delivered (the Reduce step). The framework was very successful,&lt;ref&gt;Bertolucci, Jeff [http://www.informationweek.com/big-data/news/software-platforms/hadoop-from-experiment-to-leading-big-d/240157176 &quot;Hadoop: From Experiment To Leading Big Data Platform&quot;], &quot;Information Week&quot;, 2013. Retrieved on 14 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; so others wanted to replicate the algorithm. Therefore, an implementation of the MapReduce framework was adopted by an Apache open-source project named [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster, John. [http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf &quot;MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters&quot;], &quot;Search Storage&quot;, 2004. Retrieved on 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MIKE2.0 Methodology|MIKE2.0]] is an open approach to information management that acknowledges the need for revisions due to big data implications identified in an article titled &quot;Big Data Solution Offering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/Big_Data_Solution_Offering|title=Big Data Solution Offering|publisher=MIKE2.0|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology addresses handling big data in terms of useful [[permutation]]s of data sources, [[complexity]] in interrelationships, and difficulty in deleting (or modifying) individual records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/Big_Data_Definition|title=Big Data Definition|publisher=MIKE2.0|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies show that a multiple-layer architecture is one option to address the issues that big data presents. A [[List of file systems#Distributed parallel file systems|distributed parallel]] architecture distributes data across multiple servers; these parallel execution environments can dramatically improve data processing speeds. This type of architecture inserts data into a parallel DBMS, which implements the use of MapReduce and Hadoop frameworks. This type of framework looks to make the processing power transparent to the end user by using a front-end application server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boja|first=C|author2=Pocovnicu, A |author3=Bătăgan, L. |title=Distributed Parallel Architecture for Big Data|journal=Informatica Economica|year=2012|volume=16|issue=2|pages=116–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Data Analytics for Manufacturing Applications can be based on a 5C architecture (connection, conversion, cyber, cognition, and configuration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imscenter.net/cyber-physical-platform|title=IMS_CPS — IMS Center|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[data lake]] allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management. This enables quick segregation of data into the data lake, thereby reducing the overhead time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/solving_key_businesschallenges_with_big_data_lake_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url=https://secplab.ppgia.pucpr.br/files/papers/2015-0.pdf | title= Method for testing the fault tolerance of MapReduce frameworks | publisher=Computer Networks | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Visualization, such as charts, graphs and other displays of the data

Multidimensional big data can also be represented as [[tensor]]s, which can be more efficiently handled by tensor-based computation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Future Directions in Tensor-Based Computation and Modeling |date=May 2009|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cv/tenwork/finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[multilinear subspace learning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MSLsurvey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Storage area networks need not apply |author=CNET News |date=1 April 2011 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-21546_3-20049693-10253464.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring direct-attached storage ([[Direct-attached storage|DAS]]) in its various forms from solid state drive ([[Ssd]]) to high capacity [[Serial ATA|SATA]] disk buried inside parallel processing nodes. The perception of shared storage architectures—[[Storage area network]] (SAN) and [[Network-attached storage]] (NAS) —is that they are relatively slow, complex, and expensive. These qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that thrive on system performance, commodity infrastructure, and low cost.

Real or near-real time information delivery is one of the defining characteristics of big data analytics. Latency is therefore avoided whenever and wherever possible. Data in memory is good—data on spinning disk at the other end of a [[Fiber connector|FC]] [[Storage area network|SAN]] connection is not. The cost of a [[Storage area network|SAN]] at the scale needed for analytics applications is very much higher than other storage techniques.

There are advantages as well as disadvantages to shared storage in big data analytics, but big data analytics practitioners {{As of|2011|lc=on}} did not favour it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How New Analytic Systems will Impact Storage |date=September 2011 |url=http://www.evaluatorgroup.com/document/big-data-how-new-analytic-systems-will-impact-storage-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big data has increased the demand of information management specialists in that [[Software AG]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[EMC Corporation|EMC]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[Dell]] have spent more than $15&amp;nbsp;billion on software firms specializing in data management and analytics. In 2010, this industry was worth more than $100&amp;nbsp;billion and was growing at almost 10&amp;nbsp;percent a year: about twice as fast as the software business as a whole.{{r|Economist}}

Developed economies increasingly use data-intensive technologies. There are 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion mobile-phone subscriptions worldwide, and between 1&amp;nbsp;billion and 2&amp;nbsp;billion people accessing the internet.{{r|Economist}} Between 1990 and 2005, more than 1&amp;nbsp;billion people worldwide entered the middle class, which means more people become more literate, which in turn leads to information growth. The world's effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was 281 [[petabytes]] in 1986, 471 [[petabytes]] in 1993, 2.2 exabytes in 2000, 65 [[exabytes]] in 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;martinhilbert.net&quot;/&gt; and predictions put the amount of internet traffic at 667 exabytes annually by 2014.{{r|Economist}} According to one estimate, one third of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data,&lt;ref name=&quot;HilbertContent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01972243.2013.873748|title=An Error Occurred Setting Your User Cookie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the format most useful for most big data applications. This also shows the potential of yet unused data (i.e. in the form of video and audio content).

While many vendors offer off-the-shelf solutions for Big Data, experts recommend the development of in-house solutions custom-tailored to solve the company's problem at hand if the company has sufficient technical capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/07/interview-amy-gershkoff-ebay-in-house-BI-tools.html |title=Interview: Amy Gershkoff, Director of Customer Analytics &amp; Insights, eBay on How to Design Custom In-House BI Tools |last1=Rajpurohit |first1=Anmol |date=11 July 2014 |website= KDnuggets|accessdate=2014-07-14|quote=Dr. Amy Gershkoff: &quot;Generally, I find that off-the-shelf business intelligence tools do not meet the needs of clients who want to derive custom insights from their data. Therefore, for medium-to-large organizations with access to strong technical talent, I usually recommend building custom, in-house solutions.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government ===
The use and adoption of big data within governmental processes is beneficial and allows efficiencies in terms of cost, productivity, and innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2472667/government-it/the-government-and-big-data--use--problems-and-potential.html |title=The Government and big data: Use, problems and potential |date=21 March 2012 |publisher=Computerworld |access-date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} but does not come without its flaws. Data analysis often requires multiple parts of government (central and local) to work in collaboration and create new and innovative processes to deliver the desired outcome. Below are the thought{{By whom|date=March 2016}} leading examples within the governmental big data space.

==== United States of America ====
* In 2012, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] announced the Big Data Research and Development Initiative, to explore how big data could be used to address important problems faced by the government.&lt;ref name=WH_Big_Data&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalil|first=Tom|title=Big Data is a Big Deal|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/03/29/big-data-big-deal|publisher=White House|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative is composed of 84 different big data programs spread across six departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Executive Office of the President|title=Big Data Across the Federal Government|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/big_data_fact_sheet_final_1.pdf|publisher=White House|accessdate=26 September 2012 |date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Utah Data Center]] has been constructed by the United States [[National Security Agency]]. When finished, the facility will be able to handle a large amount of information collected by the NSA over the Internet. The exact amount of storage space is unknown, but more recent sources claim it will be on the order of a few [[exabyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Bamford|first=James|title=The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/1|work=Wired Magazine|accessdate=2013-03-18|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/press_room/2011/utah_groundbreaking_ceremony.shtml|title=Groundbreaking Ceremony Held for $1.2 Billion Utah Data Center|publisher=National Security Agency Central Security Service|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hill|first=Kashmir|title=TBlueprints of NSA's Ridiculously Expensive Data Center in Utah Suggest It Holds Less Info Than Thought|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/07/24/blueprints-of-nsa-data-center-in-utah-suggest-its-storage-capacity-is-less-impressive-than-thought/|work=Forbes|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Big data analysis was in part responsible for the BJP to win the [[Indian general election, 2014|Indian General Election 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.livemint.com/Industry/bUQo8xQ3gStSAy5II9lxoK/Are-Indian-companies-making-enough-sense-of-Big-Data.html|title = News: Live Mint|date = 23 June 2014|accessdate = 2014-11-22|website = Are Indian companies making enough sense of Big Data?|publisher = Live Mint}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Indian government utilises numerous techniques to ascertain how the Indian electorate is responding to government action, as well as ideas for policy augmentation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==== United Kingdom ====
Examples of uses of big data in public services:
* Data on prescription drugs: by connecting origin, location and the time of each prescription, a research unit was able to exemplify the considerable delay between the release of any given drug, and a UK-wide adaptation of the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] guidelines. This suggests that new or most up-to-date drugs take some time to filter through to the general patient. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* Joining up data: a local authority blended data about services, such as road gritting rotas, with services for people at risk, such as 'meals on wheels'. The connection of data allowed the local authority to avoid any weather related delay.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== International development ===
Research on the effective usage of [[information and communication technologies for development]] (also known as [[ICT4D]]) suggests that big data technology can make important contributions but also present unique challenges to [[International development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unglobalpulse.org/projects/BigDataforDevelopment|title=White Paper: Big Data for Development: Opportunities &amp; Challenges (2012) – United Nations Global Pulse|publisher=|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WEF (World Economic Forum), &amp; Vital Wave Consulting.

=== Manufacturing ===
Based on TCS 2013 Global Trend Study, improvements in supply planning and product quality provide the greatest benefit of big data for manufacturing.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCS Big Data Study – Manufacturing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.tcs.com/big-data-study/manufacturing-big-data-benefits-challenges/# |title=Manufacturing: Big Data Benefits and Challenges |work= TCS Big Data Study|publisher=[[Tata Consultancy Services Limited]] |location=Mumbai, India |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big data provides an infrastructure for transparency in manufacturing industry, which is the ability to unravel uncertainties such as inconsistent component performance and availability. Predictive manufacturing as an applicable approach toward near-zero downtime and transparency requires vast amount of data and advanced prediction tools for a systematic process of data into useful information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|author2=Wu, F. |author3=Zhao, W. |author4=Ghaffari, M. |author5= Liao, L |title=Prognostics and health management design for rotary machinery systems—Reviews, methodology and applications|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|date=January 2013|volume=42|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conceptual framework of predictive manufacturing begins with data acquisition where different type of sensory data is available to acquire such as acoustics, vibration, pressure, current, voltage and controller data. Vast amount of sensory data in addition to historical data construct the big data in manufacturing. The generated big data acts as the input into predictive tools and preventive strategies such as [[Prognostics]] and Health Management (PHM).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==== Cyber-physical models ====
Current PHM implementations mostly use data during the actual usage while analytical algorithms can perform more accurately when more information throughout the machine's lifecycle, such as system configuration, physical knowledge and working principles, are included. There is a need to systematically integrate, manage and analyze machinery or process data during different stages of machine life cycle to handle data/information more efficiently and further achieve better transparency of machine health condition for manufacturing industry.

With such motivation a cyber-physical (coupled) model scheme has been developed. The coupled model is a digital twin of the real machine that operates in the cloud platform and simulates the health condition with an integrated knowledge from both data driven analytical algorithms as well as other available physical knowledge. It can also be described as a 5S systematic approach consisting of sensing, storage, synchronization, synthesis and service. The coupled model first constructs a digital image from the early design stage. System information and physical knowledge are logged during product design, based on which a simulation model is built as a reference for future analysis. Initial parameters may be statistically generalized and they can be tuned using data from testing or the manufacturing process using parameter estimation. After that step, the simulation model can be considered a mirrored image of the real machine—able to continuously record and track machine condition during the later utilization stage. Finally, with the increased connectivity offered by cloud computing technology, the coupled model also provides better accessibility of machine condition for factory managers in cases where physical access to actual equipment or machine data is limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;MfgLetters&quot; /&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
Big data analytics has helped healthcare improve by providing personalized medicine and prescriptive analytics, clinical risk intervention and predictive analytics, waste and care variability reduction, automated external and internal reporting of patient data, standardized medical terms and patient registries and fragmented point solutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref135&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.10.060|title=Impending Challenges for the Use of Big Data
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of data generated within healthcare systems is not trivial. With the added adoption of mHealth, eHealth and wearable technologies the volume of data will continue to increase. There is now an even greater need for such environments to pay greater attention to data and information quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2378016.2378021|title=Data Management Within mHealth Environments: Patient Sensors, Mobile Devices, and Databases|first1=John|last1=O'Donoghue|first2=John|last2=Herbert|date=1 October 2012|publisher=|volume=4|issue=1|pages=5:1–5:20|accessdate=16 June 2016|via=ACM Digital Library|doi=10.1145/2378016.2378021}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Big data very often means `dirty data' and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth.&quot; Human inspection at the big data scale is impossible and there is a desperate need in health service for intelligent tools for accuracy and believability control and handling of information missed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirkes2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mirkes| first1 =E.M.|last2 = Coats|first2 =T.J.|last3 = Levesley|first3 =J.|last4 = Gorban|first4 = A.N.| title = Handling missing data in large healthcare dataset: A case study of unknown trauma outcomes|url =  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300400110_Handling_missing_data_in_large_healthcare_dataset_A_case_study_of_unknown_trauma_outcomes| journal = Computers in Biology and Medicine| volume = 75| issue = | pages = 203–216| year = 2016| doi = 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
A [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey Global Institute]] study found a shortage of 1.5 million highly trained data professionals and managers&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinsey&quot;/&gt; and a number of universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
To understand how the media utilises Big Data, it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process. It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that [[wikt:practitioner|practitioners]] in Media and Advertising approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals. The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers, magazines, or television shows and instead tap into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations.  The ultimate aim is to serve, or convey, a message or content that is (statistically speaking) in line with the consumers mindset. For example, publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages (advertisements) and content (articles) to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various [[data-mining]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Couldry|first1=Nick|last2=Turow|first2=Joseph|title=Advertising, Big Data, and the Clearance of the Public Realm: Marketers’ New Approaches to the Content Subsidy|journal=International Journal of Communication|date=2014|volume=8|pages=1710–1726}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Targeting of consumers (for advertising by marketers)
* Data-capture

==== Internet of Things (IoT) ====
{{Main article|Internet of Things}}Big Data and the IoT work in conjunction.  From a media perspective, data is the key derivative of device inter-connectivity and allows accurate targeting.  The [[Internet of Things]], with the help of big data, therefore transforms the media industry, companies and even governments, opening up a new era of economic growth and competitiveness. The intersection of people, data and intelligent algorithms have far-reaching impacts on media efficiency. The wealth of data generated allows an elaborate layer on the present targeting mechanisms of the industry.

==== Technology ====
* [[eBay.com]] uses two data warehouses at 7.5 [[petabytes]] and 40PB as well as a 40PB [[Hadoop]] cluster for search, consumer recommendations, and merchandising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Tay | first=Liz |url=http://www.itnews.com.au/news/inside-ebay8217s-90pb-data-warehouse-342615 | title=Inside eBay’s 90PB data warehouse | publisher=ITNews | accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Amazon.com]] handles millions of back-end operations every day, as well as queries from more than half a million third-party sellers. The core technology that keeps Amazon running is Linux-based and as of 2005 they had the world's three largest Linux databases, with capacities of 7.8 TB, 18.5 TB, and 24.7 TB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Layton |first=Julia |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/amazon1.htm |title=Amazon Technology |publisher=Money.howstuffworks.com |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private sector ===

=== Information Technology ===
Especially since 2015, Big Data has come to prominence within [[Business Operations]] as a tool to help employees work more efficiently and streamline the collection and distribution of [[Information Technology]] (IT). The use of Big Data to attack IT and data collection issues within an enterprise is called [[IT Operations Analytics]] (ITOA).&lt;ref name=&quot;ITOA1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solnik|first1=Ray|title=The Time Has Come: Analytics Delivers for IT Operations|url=http://www.datacenterjournal.com/time-analytics-delivers-operations/|website=Data Center Journal|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By applying Big Data principles into the concepts of [[machine intelligence]] and [[deep computing]], IT departments can predict potential issues and move to provide solutions before the problems even happen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITOA1&quot; /&gt; In this time, ITOA businesses were also beginning to play a major role in [[systems management]] by offering platforms that brought individual [[data silos]] together and generated insights from the whole of the system rather than from isolated pockets of data.

The [[Large Hadron Collider]] experiments represent about 150 million sensors delivering data 40&amp;nbsp;million times per second. There are nearly 600&amp;nbsp;million collisions per second.

* As a result, only working with less than 0.001% of the sensor stream data, the data flow from all four LHC experiments represents 25 petabytes annual rate before replication (as of 2012). This becomes nearly 200 petabytes after replication.
* If all sensor data were recorded in LHC, the data flow would be extremely hard to work with. The data flow would exceed 150 million petabytes annual rate, or nearly 500 [[exabyte]]s per day, before replication. To put the number in perspective, this is equivalent to 500 [[quintillion]] (5×10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) bytes per day, almost 200 times more than all the other sources combined in the world.

* When the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS) began to collect astronomical data in 2000, it amassed more in its first few weeks than all data collected in the history of astronomy previously. Continuing at a rate of about 200&amp;nbsp;GB per night, SDSS has amassed more than 140 terabytes of information. When the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]], successor to SDSS, comes online in 2020, its designers expect it to acquire that amount of data every five days.{{r|Economist}}

Encrypted search and cluster formation in big data was demonstrated in March 2014 at the American Society of Engineering Education. Gautam Siwach engaged at ''Tackling the challenges of Big Data'' by [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] and Dr. Amir Esmailpour at UNH Research Group investigated the key features of big data as formation of clusters and their interconnections. They focused on the security of big data and the actual orientation of the term towards the presence of different type of data in an encrypted form at cloud interface by providing the raw definitions and real time examples within the technology. Moreover, they proposed an approach for identifying the encoding technique to advance towards an expedited search over encrypted text leading to the security enhancements in big data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://asee-ne.org/proceedings/2014/Student%20Papers/210.pdf |title=Encrypted Search &amp; Cluster Formation in Big Data |last1=Siwach |first1=Gautam |last2=Esmailpour |first2=Amir |date=March 2014 |year= |conference=ASEE 2014 Zone I Conference |conference-url=http://ubconferences.org/ |location=[[University of Bridgeport]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], US }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big data sets come with algorithmic challenges that previously did not exist. Hence, there is a need to fundamentally change the processing ways.&lt;ref&gt;E. Sejdić, &quot;Adapt current tools for use with big data,&quot; ''Nature,'' vol. vol. 507, no. 7492, pp. 306, Mar. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sampling Big Data ===
An important research question that can be asked about big data sets is whether you need to look at the full data to draw certain conclusions about the properties of the data or is a sample good enough. The name big data itself contains a term related to size and this is an important characteristic of big data. But [[Sampling (statistics)]] enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population. For example, there are about 600 million tweets produced every day. Is it necessary to look at all of them to determine the topics that are discussed during the day? Is it necessary to look at all the tweets to determine the sentiment on each of the topics? In manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics, vibration, pressure, current, voltage and controller data are available at short time intervals. To predict down-time it may not be necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient.

There has been some work done in Sampling algorithms for Big Data. A theoretical formulation for sampling Twitter data has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Deepan Palguna |author2=Vikas Joshi |author3=Venkatesan Chakaravarthy |author4=Ravi Kothari |author5=L. V. Subramaniam |last-author-amp=yes | title=Analysis of Sampling Algorithms for Twitter | journal=[[International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence]] | year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique ==
Critiques of the big data paradigm come in two flavors, those that question the implications of the approach itself, and those that question the way it is currently done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/joe.21642 | title = Big Data and Business Intelligence: Debunking the Myths | journal = Global Business and Organizational Excellence| volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–34 | year = 2015 | last1 = Kimble | first1 = C. | last2 = Milolidakis | first2 = G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques of the big data paradigm ===
&quot;A crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical micro-processes that lead to the emergence of the[se] typical network characteristics of Big Data&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Editorial&quot; /&gt; In their critique, Snijders, Matzat, and [[Ulf-Dietrich Reips|Reips]] point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of micro-processes. Mark Graham has leveled broad critiques at [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]]'s assertion that big data will spell the end of theory:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory|title=The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete|author=Chris Anderson|date=23 June 2008|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing in particular on the notion that big data must always be contextualized in their social, economic, and political contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Graham M. |title=Big data and the end of theory? |newspaper=The Guardian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/mar/09/big-data-theory |location=London |date=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even as companies invest eight- and nine-figure sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers, less than 40% of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so. To overcome this insight deficit, &quot;big data&quot;, no matter how comprehensive or well analyzed, must be complemented by &quot;big judgment,&quot; according to an article in the Harvard Business Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Data Won't Guarantee Good Decisions. Harvard Business Review|url=http://hbr.org/2012/04/good-data-wont-guarantee-good-decisions/ar/1|work=Shah, Shvetank; Horne, Andrew; Capellá, Jaime;|publisher=HBR.org|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much in the same line, it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably &quot;informed by the world as it was in the past, or, at best, as it currently is&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HilbertBigData2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2205145|title=Big Data for Development: From Information- to Knowledge Societies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fed by a large number of data on past experiences, algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;HilbertTEDx&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXef6yfJZAI Big Data requires Big Visions for Big Change.], Hilbert, M. (2014). London: TEDxUCL, x=independently organized TED talks&lt;/ref&gt; If the systems dynamics of the future change (if it is not a [[stationary process]]), the past can say little about the future. In order to make predictions in changing environments, it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic, which requires theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;HilbertTEDx&quot;/&gt;  As a response to this critique it has been suggested to combine big data approaches with computer simulations, such as [[agent-based model]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;HilbertBigData2013&quot; /&gt; and [[Complex Systems]]. Agent-based models are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/04/seeing-around-corners/302471/|title=Seeing Around Corners|author=Jonathan Rauch|date=1 April 2002|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, J. M., &amp; Axtell, R. L. (1996). Growing Artificial Societies: Social Science from the Bottom Up. A Bradford Book.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, use of multivariate methods that probe for the latent structure of the data, such as [[factor analysis]] and [[cluster analysis]], have proven useful as analytic approaches that go well beyond the bi-variate approaches (cross-tabs) typically employed with smaller data sets.

In health and biology, conventional scientific approaches are based on experimentation. For these approaches, the limiting factor is the relevant data that can confirm or refute the initial hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigdataparis.com/documents/Pierre-Delort-INSERM.pdf#page=5 Delort P., Big data in Biosciences, Big Data Paris, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
A new postulate is accepted now in biosciences: the information provided by the data in huge volumes ([[omics]]) without prior hypothesis is complementary and sometimes necessary to conventional approaches based on experimentation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
In the massive approaches it is the formulation of a relevant hypothesis to explain the data that is the limiting factor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} The search logic is reversed and the limits of induction (&quot;Glory of Science and Philosophy scandal&quot;, [[C. D. Broad]], 1926) are to be considered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Consumer privacy|Privacy]] advocates are concerned about the threat to privacy represented by increasing storage and integration of [[personally identifiable information]]; expert panels have released various policy recommendations to conform practice to expectations of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Ohm |title=Don't Build a Database of Ruin |publisher=Harvard Business Review |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/08/dont_build_a_database_of_ruin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Bond-Graham, ''[http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/03/iron-cagebook/ Iron Cagebook – The Logical End of Facebook's Patents],'' [[Counterpunch.org]], 2013.12.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Bond-Graham, ''[http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/09/11/inside-the-tech-industrys-startup-conference/  Inside the Tech industry’s Startup Conference],'' [[Counterpunch.org]], 2013.09.11&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques of big data execution ===
Big data has been called a &quot;fad&quot; in scientific research and its use was even made fun of as an absurd practice in a satirical example on &quot;pig data&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pigdata&quot; /&gt; Researcher [[danah boyd]] has raised concerns about the use of big data in science neglecting principles such as choosing a [[Sampling (statistics)|representative sample]] by being too concerned about actually handling the huge amounts of data.&lt;ref name=&quot;danah&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/2010/WWW2010.html | title=Privacy and Publicity in the Context of Big Data | author=[[danah boyd]] | work=[[World Wide Web Conference|WWW 2010 conference]] | date=29 April 2010 | accessdate = 2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach may lead to results [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in one way or another. Integration across heterogeneous data resources—some that might be considered &quot;big data&quot; and others not—presents formidable logistical as well as analytical challenges, but many researchers argue that such integrations are likely to represent the most promising new frontiers in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=MB |last2=Schildhauer |first2=MP |last3=Reichman |first3=OJ |last4=Bowers |first4=S |title=The New Bioinformatics: Integrating Ecological Data from the Gene to the Biosphere |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=519–544 |year=2006 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110031 |url=http://www.pnamp.org/sites/default/files/Jones2006_AREES.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the provocative article &quot;Critical Questions for Big Data&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;danah2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878| title = Critical Questions for Big Data| journal = Information, Communication &amp; Society| volume = 15| issue = 5| pages = 662–679| year = 2012| last1 = Boyd | first1 = D. | last2 = Crawford | first2 = K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors title big data a part of [[mythology]]: &quot;large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge [...], with the aura of truth, objectivity, and accuracy&quot;. Users of big data are often &quot;lost in the sheer volume of numbers&quot;, and &quot;working with Big Data is still subjective, and what it quantifies does not necessarily have a closer claim on objective truth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;danah2&quot; /&gt; Recent developments in BI domain, such as pro-active reporting especially target improvements in usability of Big Data, through automated filtering of non-useful data and correlations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Big Decisions White Paper&quot;&gt;[http://www.fortewares.com/Administrator/userfiles/Banner/forte-wares--pro-active-reporting_EN.pdf Failure to Launch: From Big Data to Big Decisions], Forte Wares.&lt;/ref&gt;

Big data analysis is often shallow compared to analysis of smaller data sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;kdnuggets-berchthold&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/08/interview-michael-berthold-knime-research-big-data-privacy-part2.html|title=Interview: Michael Berthold, KNIME Founder, on Research, Creativity, Big Data, and Privacy, Part 2|date=12 August 2014|author=Gregory Piatetsky|authorlink=Gregory I. Piatetsky-Shapiro|publisher=KDnuggets|accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many big data projects, there is no large data analysis happening, but the challenge is the [[extract, transform, load]] part of data preprocessing.&lt;ref name=&quot;kdnuggets-berchthold&quot; /&gt;

Big data is a [[buzzword]] and a &quot;vague term&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pelt|first1=Mason|title=&quot;Big Data&quot; is an over used buzzword and this Twitter bot proves it|url=http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/26/big-data-is-an-over-used-buzzword-and-this-twitter-bot-proves-it/|website=siliconangle.com|publisher=SiliconANGLE|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ft-harford&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/21a6e7d8-b479-11e3-a09a-00144feabdc0.html |title=Big data: are we making a big mistake? |last1=Harford |first1=Tim |date=28 March 2014 |website=[[Financial Times]] |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at the same time an &quot;obsession&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ft-harford&quot; /&gt; with entrepreneurs, consultants, scientists and the media. Big data showcases such as [[Google Flu Trends]] failed to deliver good predictions in recent years, overstating the flu outbreaks by a factor of two. Similarly, [[Academy awards]] and election predictions solely based on Twitter were more often off than on target.
Big data often poses the same challenges as small data; and adding more data does not solve problems of bias, but may emphasize other problems. In particular data sources such as Twitter are not representative of the overall population, and results drawn from such sources may then lead to wrong conclusions. [[Google Translate]]—which is based on big data statistical analysis of text—does a good job at translating web pages. However, results from specialized domains may be dramatically skewed.
On the other hand, big data may also introduce new problems, such as the [[multiple comparisons problem]]: simultaneously testing a large set of hypotheses is likely to produce many false results that mistakenly appear significant.
Ioannidis argued that &quot;most published research findings are false&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ioannidis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J. P. A. | authorlink1 = John P. A. Ioannidis| title = Why Most Published Research Findings Are False | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = e124 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16060722 | pmc = 1182327 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to essentially the same effect: when many scientific teams and researchers each perform many experiments (i.e. process a big amount of scientific data; although not with big data technology), the likelihood of a &quot;significant&quot; result being actually false grows fast – even more so, when only positive results are published.
&lt;!-- sorry, this started overlapping with above section more and more... merging is welcome; I already dropped the intended subheadline &quot;Hype cycle and inflated expectations&quot;. --&gt;
